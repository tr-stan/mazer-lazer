# mazer-lazer
This game will comprise a maze filled with traps and hints, with a cipher located at the end of the maze that you must solve to break free.

## OVERVIEW
I would like to create a cryptic maze game where you can collect clues to answer quizzes/ciphers and find your way out/exit the maze. Eventually I want to have multiple levels. Lasers may be involved somehow. 

## GOALS
Create maze environment on screen/canvas that player can traverse to find clues. 
Put a cipher on the last “door” or chest that must be broken to win the game. 

## SPECIFICATIONS
The player would have 9 lives and x number of attempts to crack a code before losing a life. They could also take the wrong path and lose a life. Maybe the player prototype could have functions for last-minute saves if done right. Clues/keys could be hidden behind booby traps, and they would provide hints to solving the cipher at the last gate/chest. Maybe even,  they could get a special treasure if they get all clues. hasItemX===true, hasItemY===true etc.

## MILESTONES
